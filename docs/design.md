## Game Design

The Earth has collapsed into chaos as the Kukko virus has almost wiped out all of humanity. In the
beginning there were attempts at stopping the virus through quarantine and social distancing but
as measures were taken too late, there was soon nothing that could have been done. After half a year
the society we know broke down and people reverted back to a barbaric way of living. Everyone fends
for themselves, trying to outlive the virus.

Out on the streets there is a rumour that some few brave souls have barricaded themselves in a lab
trying to find a cure. As people are dying every day, the researchers have to fight against time if
there is to be any humans to save when they essentially find the cure. 

## Introduction

- The player finds instructions for the cure left behind by a previous team of researchers
- The instructions are complex and require the player to complete various tasks using research points (RP)
- The tasks are organized in a tree structure so one task may open up further tasks
- Once all tasks are completed, the player can create the cure and the game can end
